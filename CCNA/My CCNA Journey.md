# My CCNA Journey #
On March 19, I successfully obtained my Cisco CCNA certification after a 7-month long journey. This certification held a lot of value to me as a person not only because of its difficulty for a foundational exam, but the tenacity and will it took to obtain this certification.

## Resources Used ##
1.	**Jeremy IT Lab (Free on YouTube)**: This is by far the best resource out there (and it’s FREE!). Jeremy goes in-depth on every single topic that he covers almost every nuance you could possibly expect on the CCNA. The labs
   he has that complement each lesson help reinforce what you learned in the lecture. Take advantage of it!
  	
2.	**CCNA Certification Study Guide Volume 1 and 2: Exam 200-301 v1.1 (Sybex Study Guide) By Todd Lammie and Donald Robb**: These two Sybex Books come with a complimentary online access to a test bank for one year upon registration
   on Sybex Wiley Online. This was a good supplementary material that gave me test questions online to practice (500+ questions combined from both books). These helped me reinforce learned concepts as I was going through Jeremy’s IT Lab.
  	 
3.	**Boson ExSim and NetSim**: I originally wasn’t going to use either of these when I first started CCNA. However, after reading so many reddit posts from people on CCNA subreddit who believed they would not have passed it without Boson,
  I felt compelled (especially once closer to exam date) to purchase these to ensure I maximize my chances of passing. Looking back, I do believe ExSim was necessary resource while NetSim was cherry on top (good to have but not mandatory).
  ExSim not only helped me practice pacing myself for the real exam, but it revealed my weak areas that I needed to cover prior to the exam.

4.	**r/CCNA subreddit**: This was mostly used to pick up tips and tricks for what other test takers did when preparing for their exams and passing. While individual reddit tips may not mean much, reoccurring tips across many users I took
  into consideration for my preparation.

## Preparation ##
***I. Initial Learning***

I first started studying for CCNA in July 2024 after getting my CompTIA Network+. Despite passing Network+, I was disappointed in my performance. I set out on a resolve by passing my CCNA but also giving myself enough time to familiarize myself 
with Networking fundamentals, so I set out an initial goal to pass my exam by end of 2024. While my initial motivation was high and I was pushing through Jeremy IT Lab video content quickly, circumstances changed and caused me to slow down. Additionally,
I found some of the content (notably OSPF and FHRP) too nuanced and quite boring to where I having trouble understanding what I was consuming.

***II. Picking it up Full Speed - 2025***

After a temporary slump towards the end of 2024, I decided to pick this exam back up, resolving to get it by spring 2025, so I scheduled my exam for March 2025, knowing that once I scheduled it, I would have no choice but to push myself to get it 
(this is one of the best ways I found when pushing myself to get a certification: scheduling the exam ahead of time and building my study schedule around it). Around this time, I also decided to get NetSim because I felt the labbing I did in Jeremy’s 
IT Lab was not enough, so I purchased the 3-month NetSim subscription to give myself more opportunities to practice cisco CLI. Looking back, I do not believe this was mandatory, but it helped getting the Command-line repetition in to where I can 
comfortably navigate the command line. 

***III. Two Weeks Before Exam***

Still not feeling confident, I was browsing through r/ccna  subreddit of what other CCNA test takers did when preparing for the exam. I noticed how much people praised Boson ExSim as part of their preparation and how they would have likely not passed if it was not for ExSim. Learning this, I decided to buy ExSim and give it a try. In my first ExSim exam (Exam A), I got 50 percent, which blew my confidence a little. But then I remembered reading on subreddit that many people also had similar experience where they scored low score on Boson prior to passing the exam. The important thing to remember was that Boson was a great indicator for weak topic areas. So, I reviewed all my wrong answers and took note on it before going back to take it in study mode. Repeating this for Exam B, C, and D, I slowly increased my confidence for both simulation and theory questions. 

## Advice to other aspiring CCNA test takers ## 

***I. Lab Lab Lab!***

Like many folks online say, you HAVE TO LAB if you want to pass this exam. And it is not just because labbing reinforces theory, but also it helps you with any CLI-based questions. Knowing what those commands do helps you quickly find correct set of 
commands you need. Once you lab to the point it is borderline boring, that’s when you know you have it down comfortably because you can recall the correct commands and type it quickly.

***II.	ExSim Boson and Pacing***

As Cisco exams do not let you go back once you answer a question, you must figure out how to pace yourself throughout the exam given this constraint. This was why I thought ExSim significantly increased 
my confidence because it gave me an opportunity to practice in a simulated test environment where I do not go back to a previous answer while figuring out a comfortable pace that works for me.

***III. Answer Every Question***

What makes Cisco Exams challenging is that once you answer a question, you are not allowed to go back. So it is important to try answering every question to give yourself a non-zero chance of getting a question right in the event where you are presented
with a question you do not know the answer to.

***IV.	Learn how to Subnet!***

The single most important skills you need to have for this exam (and real life too). A lot of questions will involve subnetting, so mastering this is essential. If you enjoy math, then subnetting should be fun.
