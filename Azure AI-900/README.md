# Azure AI-900 Experience - Does AI live up to its hype ?? #

Following the completion of my Azure AZ-900, I successfully passed Azure AI-900 on 11-7-2025. The thought of obtaining this certification was born upon realization that I can get a 50 percent discount for this certification as part of attending Microsoft's Virtual Training Days that they offer for several of their 900 series exam. Intrigued, I signed up and committed myself to this exam to hopefully get a more concrete understanding of AI instead of relying on buzzwords that many IT leaders throw around concerning AI like they did when the cloud was first realized.
