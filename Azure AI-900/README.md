# Azure AI-900 Experience - Does AI live up to its hype ?? #

Following the completion of my [Azure AZ-900](https://github.com/bobchen48/Writeups/tree/main/Azure%20Fundamental%20AZ-900), I successfully passed Azure AI-900 on 11-7-2025. The thought of obtaining this certification was born upon realization that I can get a 50 percent discount for this certification as part of attending Microsoft's Virtual Training Days that they offer for several of their 900 series exam. Intrigued, I signed up and committed myself to this exam to hopefully get a more concrete understanding of AI instead of relying on buzzwords that many IT leaders throw around concerning AI like they did when the cloud was first realized.

## Resources Used ##
1. [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification): Microsoft's official Learning for AI-900. Like my Azure-900, I reasoned going through the official Microsoft course for this exam would be beneficial.
2. [Microsoft Virtual Training](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/events/category/microsoft-virtual-training-days): These are free instructor led courses that Microsoft offers throughout the years, especially for their 900 series exams. By attending one of these for the 900 exam, you can get a discount for the respective 900 exam the course is associated with. That was my primary motivation to set time to attend these.
3. LinkedIn Learning AI-900 by Microsoft Press and Tim Warner: A "Crash Course" I discovered on LinkedIn Learning that I adopted when reviewing closer to my certification date.

## Background - My initial AI Exposure ##
My first exposure to AI predates back to a conference I attended in 2024 at Purdue conference known as [CERIAS (Center for Education and Research for Information Assurance and Security)](https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/site/symposium2024/). There, I heard many keynote speeches, discussions, and presentations presented by researchers, students, and other industry professionals discussing the state of Information Security, especially concerning AI. I concretely remember one AI discussion about the concept of unfair bias present in AI and a neutral discussions about how features were selected when evaluating AI models. Although I was genuinely impressed by the sheer research that were made, I also thought it was way too much repetition to the point it felt to me the whole conference that day was "AI this, AI that, and AI everything"

## Initial Prepartion - Course Explorations & Selection ##
The first course I chose to start with was the Microsoft Virtual Training Day, which I stumbled upon at a Starbucks while searching for study materials to prepare for AI-900. I was excited to learn that Microsoft not only offers free training for their 900-level certifications but also provides a discount on the exam for participants who attend the sessions.

I joined the training day expecting a live presenter to guide us through the material. However, about 30 minutes in, something felt off. The delivery was so polished and sharp that it didn’t seem like a real person was behind the screen. A quick Google search confirmed my suspicion: the entire session was pre-recorded.

Although I appreciated receiving the discount voucher afterward, I felt a bit disappointed with the overall experience and decided I needed another way to reinforce what I’d learned. That led me to my second passthrough—the Microsoft Learn platform for the AI-900 certification.

What really caught my attention was how Microsoft offered two types of content delivery: traditional text-based lessons and AI-generated video modules. Watching the AI-generated videos was surprisingly fascinating—not so much for the content itself, but for the realization that such a seamless, AI-driven learning experience was even possible. It gave me a new appreciation for how technology is shaping education and training.

## Third Passthrough - LinkedIn Learning ##
When I used Microsoft’s Virtual Training Courses and Learn platform, I found it really hard to take meaningful notes. As a learner, I was never able to take notes in a short span of time as I preferred to pause for an extended period of time to write notes down, which was especially not possible during Virtual training day. Eventually, I realized I’d have to rely on a different approach: repetition. Instead of focusing on note-taking, I decided to reinforce the material by exposing myself to it multiple times through different courses. That’s when I discovered I could access LinkedIn Learning for free through my local library. It felt like a small win, and I ended up watching an entire LinkedIn Learning course series to reinforce my understanding from the other two courses.

## Exam Date and afterthought ##
On the day of the exam, I woke up feeling a little off, not quite myself. I knew I still had to take it, but my attitude toward the whole thing was different this time. Instead of the usual excitement and drive I’ve felt for past certification exams, my mindset had shifted to, “Let’s just get this over with.” Even though I passed, the experience left a bad taste in my mouth—it was probably most uncomfortable exam experience I’ve ever had from a mental standpoint. I remember walking out of the testing center feeling dizzy and drained, just wanting to get home. All I could think about was going for a walk and trying to clear my head after such a rough day.

Ultimately, although I am fascinated that AI is as powerful as is already, I also believe AI is a bit overhyped and not as magic as people believe it to be. However, as an IT professional, adopting AI is an essential skill to stay competitive in the job market as I continue down my career.

Additionally, my exam score was a tellsign that if I were to continue down the Azure pathway into AZ-104, I would need to give double the effort and prepare seriously if I am to pass AZ-104.
