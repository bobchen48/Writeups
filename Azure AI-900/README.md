# Azure AI-900 Experience - Does AI live up to its hype ?? #

Following the completion of my [Azure AZ-900](https://github.com/bobchen48/Writeups/tree/main/Azure%20Fundamental%20AZ-900), I successfully passed Azure AI-900 on 11-7-2025. The thought of obtaining this certification was born upon realization that I can get a 50 percent discount for this certification as part of attending Microsoft's Virtual Training Days that they offer for several of their 900 series exam. Intrigued, I signed up and committed myself to this exam to hopefully get a more concrete understanding of AI instead of relying on buzzwords that many IT leaders throw around concerning AI like they did when the cloud was first realized.

## Resources Used ##
1. [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification): Microsoft's official Learning for AI-900. Like my Azure-900, I reasoned going through the official Microsoft course for this exam would be beneficial.
2. [Microsoft Virtual Training](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/events/category/microsoft-virtual-training-days): These are free instructor led courses that Microsoft offers throughout the years, especially for their 900 series exams. By attending one of these for the 900 exam, you can get a discount for the respective 900 exam the course is associated with. That was my primary motivation to set time to attend these.
3. LinkedIn Learning AI-900 by Microsoft Press and Tim Warner: A "Crash Course" I discovered on LinkedIn Learning that I adopted when reviewing closer to my certification date.

## Background - My initial AI Exposure ##
My first exposure to AI predates back to a conference I attended in 2024 at Purdue conference known as [CERIAS (Center for Education and Research for Information Assurance and Security)](https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/site/symposium2024/). There, I heard many keynote speeches, discussions, and presentations presented by researchers, students, and other industry professionals discussing the state of Information Security, especially concerning AI. I concretely remember one AI discussion about the concept of unfair bias present in AI and a neutral discussions about how features were selected when evaluating AI models. Although I was genuinely impressed by the sheer research that were made, I also thought it was way too much repetition to the point it felt to me the whole conference that day was "AI this, AI that, and AI everything"

## Initial Prepartion - Course Explorations & Selection ##

The first course I chose for this course was the Microsoft Virtual Training Day, which I encountered at Starabucks while I was searching for training materials. I was excited to learn that Micorosft not only offers the free training for their 900 series certifications, but they also discount the 900 certifications for those that attend the training.
