# Azure AI-900 Experience - Does AI live up to its hype ?? #

Following the completion of my [Azure AZ-900](https://github.com/bobchen48/Writeups/tree/main/Azure%20Fundamental%20AZ-900), I successfully passed Azure AI-900 on 11-7-2025. The thought of obtaining this certification was born upon realization that I can get a 50 percent discount for this certification as part of attending Microsoft's Virtual Training Days that they offer for several of their 900 series exam. Intrigued, I signed up and committed myself to this exam to hopefully get a more concrete understanding of AI instead of relying on buzzwords that many IT leaders throw around concerning AI like they did when the cloud was first realized.

## Resources Used ##
1. [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification): Microsoft's official Learning for AI-900. Like my Azure-900, I reasoned going through the official Microsoft course for this exam would be beneficial.
2. [Microsoft Virtual Training](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/events/category/microsoft-virtual-training-days): These are free instructor led courses that Microsoft offers throughout the years, especially for their 900 series exams. By attending one of these for the 900 exam, you can get a discount for the respective 900 exam the course is associated with. That was my primary motivation to set time to attend these.
3. LinkedIn Learning AI-900 by Microsoft Press and Tim Warner: A "Crash Course" I discovered on LinkedIn Learning that I adopted when reviewing closer to my certification date.

## Background - My initial AI Exposure ##
My first exposure to AI predates back to a conference I attended in 2024 at Purdue conference known as [CERIAS (Center for Education and Research for Information Assurance and Security)](https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/site/symposium2024/). There, I heard many keynote speeches, discussions, and presentations presented by researchers, students, and other industry professionals discussing the state of Information Security, especially concerning AI. I concretely remember one AI discussion about the concept of unfair bias present in AI and a neutral discussions about how features were selected when evaluating AI models. Although I was genuinely impressed by the sheer research that were made, I also thought it was way too much repetition to the point it felt to me the whole conference that day was "AI this, AI that, and AI everything"

## Initial Prepartion - Course Explorations & Selection ##
The first course I chose for this course was the Microsoft Virtual Training Day, which I encountered at Starabucks while I was searching for training materials. I was excited to learn that Micorosft not only offers the free training for their 900 series certifications, but they also discount the 900 certifications for those that attend the training.

I attend training day anticipating an actual live presenter to be there to present the lesson. However, 30 minutes in, I felt something strange: the presenation was too "eloquent" in terms of delivery that it didn't feel like it was an actual live presenter behind the screen. A simple Google search led me to realize that the entire training is pre-recorded, thus confirming my suspicion.

## Second Passthrough - Microsoft Learning (AI-900) ##
Although I was happy that I received a discount voucher after the training, I was slightly disappointed in the content that I wanted another passthrough from a different course to reinforce my knowledge I learned from the virtual training. Naturally, I delve into Microsoft's Official Learning.

One thing that amazed me about the Microsoft Course was that they offered two delivery in some of the content modules: Regular Text-based content and AI video-generated. Watching the AI-generated video delivery, I was genuinelly impressed purely by the fact that an AI-generated video content was possible.

## Third Passthrough - LinkedIn Learning ##
Both Microsoft's Virtual Training Course and Learn I found it really hard to take good notes to follow so I ended up never taking good notes. As a result, I decided I'd pass it through sheer repetition of content across different course. As a result, I watched a LinkedIn course series after discovering that I could get free access to LinkedIn Learning using my library card through partnerships between LinkedIn Learning and public libaries. 

Looking back, I don't really have much to say about this course as it was a review of my prev. courses.

## Exam Date and after ##
On exam date, I woke up feeling slightly under the weather. Despite this, I was obligated to take the exam. However, I recall my attitude towards this exam became "I just want to go take the test and get it over with" instead of genuine excitment that I've had from previous certification exam. Despite passing, this was the worst experience I had taking an IT certification. I remember even after the certification, I was just feeling dizzy and needed to get home asap so I can go out and walk so I can shake off my headache I was feeling during and after the exam.
