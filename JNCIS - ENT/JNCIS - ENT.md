# JNCIA - ENT - Lesson on Resilience and Bouncing back from Failure #

On 9-8-2025, I was able to accomplish the JNCIS-ENT (Juniper Enterprise Routing and Switching, Specialist) Exam. Accomplishing this one to meant more than just anoter certification because this one taught me the importance of being resilient and bouncing back from failure.

## Resources Used ##
1. **Udemy Course Juniper Networks JNCIS-ENT Certification: Master the Essentials by Ben Jacobson**: This was my main video course I used to prepare for this certification. Looking back, I felt like this course was not very helpful in contributing to my preparation for the exam. I wished I used CBTNuggets course that was available instead. I was drawn to this course originally because it was only 12 hours long, but shorter doesn't always mean better
2. **Juniper Open Learning JNCIS-ENT**: I initially paired this as a supplemental to my Udemy course, but looking back, this course was the reason that likely helped me passed the exam as it taught many of the content that were missed entirely or covered very briefly in the Udemy course
3. **Udemy Course: Juniper JNCIS-ENT (JN0-351) - Practice Exam by Nerd Exams**: Like my previous Juniper Exams (Junos and JNCIA - SEC), I used Nerd Exams JNCIS-ENT Exam prep). This combined with the practice questions on Juniper Open Learning was enough practice questions to prepare me.

## Preamble ##
Back around June to July 2025 after passing my [JNCIA - SEC](https://github.com/bobchen48/Writeups/blob/main/JNCIA%20-%20SEC/JNCIA%20-%20SEC%3A%20My%20Certification%20Journey.md), I felt immense confidence while preparing for VMware Cloud Foundation - Administrator (5.2) Exam that I was going to crush it in July. However, I was knocked down to reality as my [exam score showed a FAIL](https://github.com/bobchen48/Writeups/blob/main/VCP%20-%20VCF%20(VMware%20Cloud%20Foundation)%205.2/VCP-VCF.md)
