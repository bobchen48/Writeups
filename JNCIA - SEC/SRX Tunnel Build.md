# SRX Route-based VPN Tunnel Building (Conceptual) #

One of the crucial skill learned in JNCIA - SEC was the anatomy of SRX VPN Tunnel. VPN Tunnel sounds cool when it works right? So why not learn the parts that work together to create the VPN!

I remember when I first encountered a VPN configuration. It was 30+ lines of configuration that left my minds blown. Thanks to JNCIA - SEC however, I learned that those 30 lines of configuration can be broken down into a series of steps that work together to build the VPN. But instead of just throwing a ton of commands here, I will explain the conceptual idea behind a VPN Build, specifically _Route-Based VPN_. The steps to build a SRX Route-based VPN are as follows:

## Creating a Secure Tunnel, Security Zones, and Routes ##

## Phase 1 (IKE - Internet Key Exchange) ##

## Phase 2 - IPSec ##

## Security Policy ##
