# VCP VCF - Dealing with (Temporary) setback #

On 7-21-2025, I attempted VMware by Broadcom's [VCP - VCF Administrator 2V0 - 11.25](https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/vcp-vvf-arch-3) Exam. While this exam was my first serious introduction to VMware product at an enterprise level, my efforts were not successful this time around as I failed with a score of 237 (300 points needed to pass). The test was scored from a scaled score of 100 to 500.

## My Study Resources ##
1. **Instructor-Led Broadcom course: Deploy, Configure, Manage [5.2]**: This was live course that Broadcom recommended all VCF test takers to attend prior to taking the exam. As part of the instructor-led course, there were supplementary resources  While I wasn't sure about the value of this course, the intensity of it (amount of information offered in 5 days) was very valueable.
2. **Self-Paced (On-Demand) course: Deploy, Configure, Manage [5.2]**: This was a pre-recorded self-paced course that consists of pre-recorded lecture videos. The slides presented in this course was exactly the same as instructor-led course.
3. **Udemy Practice Question**: I bought a Udemy Practice question set to try to give myself extra questions. Looking back, this Udemy course I purchased was rather suboptimal and did not meaningful contribute to my preparation as much as I hoped it would have.
4. **Quizlet Flashcard Set**: I noticed there was a scarcity of good resources available for the VCP VCF exam because it was relatively "new" and not matured by en masse. To compensate for this lack of available resources, I aggregated practice questions that I obtained from my courses and other online courses into my custom-made multiple-choice flash cards.

## First Week - 5-Day Instructor Course ## 
Like Broadcom recommended on their exam objective, I attended the 5-day instructor course to learn about VMware's automated solution: Vmware cloud foundation. As someone who worked with vSphere at my job, I was curious about VMware's VCF offering and the parts that make up VCF, starting with the Cloud Builder and SDDC Manager.

Initially, I was blown away and confused by all the moving components that make up VCF, On Day 4, it started to click where I realize the entire course was essentially a greenfield deployment using VCF. This realization clarified the significance of these moving components and made me think I could take this exam in 1 month. 

## Week 2 to 3 - Self-Paced (On-Demand) course ##
Despite my confidence boost from my online course, I still wanted to take advantage of the self-paced course offering as means to review the content in hopes of solidifying my knowledge prior to the exam. While I initially took notes, the time constraint leading up to the exam caused me to slip off on my notes and I started to focus on the big idea instead of the detail (I will talk more regarding this on in my reflection). Nevertheless, between my practice quest

## Week 4 and 5 leading up to Exam ##
I spent the final 2 weeks leading up the to exam, I was focused on wrapping up my self-paced course and going through as many review questions as I can find (good and bad) from online resources to test my applied knowledgede pertaining to VCF.

On Exam date, I went in, feeling decent about my chances and started the exam. It was at this point that my expectation for the exam was completely shattered. Almost 75 percent of my exam (I mean this!) were multi-answer questions that where two to four answers were correct and I had to be able to select them all. While I thought it was generous Broadcom gave 135 minutes to take a 60-question exam, I did not anticipate how many of these multi-answer questions I would actually encounter. I recall that for many of the questions that had select anywhere from 2 to 4 correct choice, I would be left in a situation where I was confident some of my answer choices, but all. In my review, I went through 40 out of the 60 questions just as a ressurance in hopes of correcting any doubts I had. Alas, after I submitted my answer, I was met with a "Fail". 

## What went wrong (My POV) && Moving forward ##
I recall reading another successful test taker's writeup where he mentions that the exam tests your ability to know "how to configure VCF" (understanding requirements, procedure, troubleshooting) instead of the "Why VCF". Because I was more focused on high-level ideas and the Whys of VCF, I feel I either incorrectly prepared for the exam or I did not actually prepare as much as I should have. Maybe if I took some extra courses on troubleshooting VCF, I may have had a better chance. However, everything is retroactive in perspective - easy to know what I could have done if I could have gone back, but I won't know on-the-spot. 

While I am disappointed in my exam result, I am still happy to have come out learning more about VMware VCF than I would hve otherwise (if I did not go through this exam). Although I do not foresee an immediate plan to pursue this exam as I wanted to not dwell on my poor testing experience for this exam, I can see myself returning to Broadcom exam in the future (specifically Network Virtualization) down the road to continue my journey of becoming an IT Networking professional.

"Failure is just a temporary setback" I will see you all in the next exam.
