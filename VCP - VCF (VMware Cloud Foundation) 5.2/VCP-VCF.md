# VCP VCF - Dealing with (Temporary) setback #

On 7-21-2025, I attempted VMware by Broadcom's [VCP - VCF Administrator 2V0 - 11.25](https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/vcp-vvf-arch-3) Exam. While this exam was my first serious introduction to VMware product at an enterprise level, my efforts were not successful this time around as I failed with a score of 237 (300 points needed to pass). The test was scored from a scaled score of 100 to 500.

## My Study Resources ##
1. **Instructor-Led Broadcom course: Deploy, Configure, Manage [5.2]**: This was live course that Broadcom recommended all VCF test takers to attend prior to taking the exam. As part of the instructor-led course, there were supplementary resources  While I wasn't sure about the value of this course, the intensity of it (amount of information offered in 5 days) was very valueable.
2. **Self-Paced (On-Demand) course: Deploy, Configure, Manage [5.2]**: This was a pre-recorded self-paced course that consists of pre-recorded lecture videos. The slides presented in this course was exactly the same as instructor-led course.
3. **Udemy Practice Question**: I bought a Udemy Practice question set to try to give myself extra questions. Looking back, this Udemy course I purchased was rather suboptimal and did not meaningful contribute to my preparation as much as I hoped it would have.
4. **Quizlet Flashcard Set**: I noticed there was a scarcity of good resources available for the VCP VCF exam because it was relatively "new" and not matured by en masse. To compensate for this lack of available resources, I aggregated practice questions that I obtained from my courses and other online courses into my custom-made multiple-choice flash cards.

## First Week - 5-Day Instructor Course ## 
Like Broadcom recommended on their exam objective, I attended the 5-day instructor course to learn about VMware's automated solution: Vmware cloud foundation. As someone who worked with vSphere at my job, I was curious about VMware's VCF offering and the parts that make up VCF, starting with the Cloud Builder and SDDC Manager.

Initially, I was blown away and confused by all the moving components that make up VCF, On Day 4, it started to click where I realize the entire course was essentially a greenfield deployment using VCF. This realization clarified the significance of these moving components and made me think I could take this exam in 1 month. 

## Week 2 to 3 - Self-Paced (On-Demand) course ##
Despite my confidence boost from my online course, I still wanted to take advantage of the self-paced course offering as means to review the content in hopes of solidifying my knowledge prior to the exam. While I initially took notes, the time constraint leading up to the exam caused me to slip off on my notes and I started to focus on the big idea instead of the detail (I will talk more regarding this on in my reflection). Nevertheless, between my practice quest
