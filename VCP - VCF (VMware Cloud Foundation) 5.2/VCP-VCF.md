On 7-21-2025, I attempted VMware by Broadcom's [VCP - VCF Administrator 2V0 - 11.25](https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/vcp-vvf-arch-3) Exam.

2. **Self-Paced (On-Demand) course: Deploy, Configure, Manage [5.2]**: This was a pre-recorded self-paced course that consists of pre-recorded lecture videos. The slides presented in this course was exactly the same as instructor-led course.
3. **Udemy Practice Question**: I bought a Udemy Practice question set to try to give myself extra questions. Looking back, this Udemy course I purchased was rather suboptimal and did not meaningful contribute to my preparation as much as I hoped it would have.
