# Azure Fundamental (AZ-900) - Connecting new information to past experience #

On October 6, 2025, I earned my Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) certification. My initial interest was sparked by hearing Entra ID and other Azure terminology mentioned frequently. After researching online forums and learning the value of Azure, I decided to pursue the certification out of curiosity. While the exam was another step towards my knowledge collection, the overall process changed my perspective in how I think about Networking problems. 

## Resources Used ##
1. **CBT Nuggets - AZ-900 Course**: Video course I used for this certification. As I had access to CBT Nuggets through work, I decided this time I wanted to give CBT Nuggets a try.
   
2. [**Microsoft Learn**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/az-900t00): Microsoft's official learning for AZ-900. I wanted to use it as a supplement to the CBT Nuggets video course for AZ-900. The practice assessment at the end of the Microsoft course was a valuable tool for reinforcing and validating the knowledge I acquired from both resources. 

3. AZ-900 Pracitce Test 2025: This was a Mobile app I found on Google Play 3 days before my exam date. I have used these type of pocket prep for previous exams including CCNA and Network+. The sheer convenience of it being a practice test from a mobile app makes it super convenient to take out and practice a couple of questions spradically when I have moments of downtime.

## Preamble - My headspace shortly after start studying ##
It was about a week after I passed the JNCIS - ENT
 certification. I was sitting at a local Starbucks, browsing for training materials to start preparing for the AZ-900. At the same time, I found myself wondering: What can I do next to maintain this study momentum? My head was buzzing with possibilities.

Around that time, I also began exploring software engineering podcasts—particularly those by Ryan Peterman. That quickly led me to dive into system design interview videos by Hello Interviews. Although I’m not a software engineer myself, I found these podcast episodes incredibly fascinating and inspiring. I was amazed by how people systematically walk through designing the architecture behind major platforms like Facebook posts, Uber, and Ticketmaster—applications that have profoundly shaped our everyday lives.

While it's hard to fully capture the emotions I felt during that period, I vividly remember being both overwhelmed and excited. That curiosity pushed me to dig deeper, especially as I reflected on the troubleshooting and problem-solving I’ve done in my own work. It was the beginning of a broader journey into understanding how complex systems are built and maintained—something that continues to inspire me as I continue to build my troubleshooting methodology.

## Study Session (CBT Nuggets Videos + Microsoft Learn) ##
My first two weeks of studying were focused on video training courses through CBT Nuggets. To deepen my learning, I began actively connecting Azure concepts to real-world problems I’ve encountered at work. This approach helped me better apply what I was learning to practical scenarios.

For example, while studying Azure ExpressRoute—a service that creates a private, dedicated network connection from on-premises infrastructure to an Azure datacenter—I distinctly remembered a ticket case where a client had asked about the feasibility of using a Site-to-Site VPN as a backup connectivity option. At the time, I wasn’t sure if that was possible. However, during the course, I learned that it is indeed feasible to implement a Site-to-Site VPN as a redundant route alongside Azure ExpressRoute.

Additionally, anytime I wasn't sure of what an Azure Service was meant to do, I would Google the Azure Service and see if there was an AWS equivalent of it, drawing my previous AWS Certification to help me draw connection between the Azure Service and its AWS direct counterpart. This method was really effective for developing a deeper connection to my learning as I am not taking material at face value, but instead preferring a more inquisitive approach.

## Final 3 Days leading up to Exam ##
While I was reading on /AzureCertification subreddit that the exam was easy and required minimal prep work, I still wanted to make sure I was adequately prepared for it by my own accords. On Google Play I casually searched AZ-900 to see if I can find any last-minute pocket prep app. To my surprise, I saw a mobile application for AZ-900 practice questions. I went ahead and download it to go through the questions, ensuring I am able to apply the concepts I learned in my studies. 

On Exam Date, I went in confidently went in and knocked it out. Next Up, Aazure AI-900

## Afterthought ##
While I do not have much to say about the exam itself, I will say my mind was more inquisitive when studying for it because I was attempting to connect my learning material to past work tickets that I solved or encountered even if it's not a straight one-to-one mapping. I found that connecting learning material to work experience really helped me be more inquisitive about what I am consuming.
