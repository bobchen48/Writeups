# Azure Fundamental (AZ-900) - Connecting theory with past experience #

On 10-6-2025, I obtained the Azure Fundamental (AZ-900) certification. My motivation for this certification originally stemmed from when people keep mentioning Entra ID amongst other Azure terminology. Naturally, I would opt to find out myself what Azure is really about. Looking back, I found it more interesting on my headspace throughout the lifecycle studying this exam as well how I specifically learned for this exam unlike previous exams. Let's begin

## Resources Used ##
1. **CBT Nuggets - AZ-900 Course**: The main video course I used for this certification. As I had access to CBT Nuggets through my work, I decided that I wanted to give it a chance this time when I was preparing for the exam. Unlike Udemy, CBTNuggets video for this course felt "unstructured". Lessons were taught using digramming to teach ideas and connect them together where as many of my previous certification video courses were more powerpoint/slideshow oriented. The advantage of this type of course presentation using diagramming made me had to critically think what were the big ideas/takeaways in each videos without relying on copying any slideshow bullet points that were prevalent in many of my previous IT certifications
   
2. [**Microsoft Learn**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/az-900t00): Microsoft's official learning for AZ-900. This was my supplementary course that I used as a 2nd pass after going through CBT Nuggets video course. What I found most helpful in this resource was the practice assessment question that was at the end of the course where I could validate the knowledge i gained from both courses

3. AZ-900 Pracitce Test 2025: This was a Mobile app I found on Google Play 3 days before my exam date. I have used these type of pocket prep for previous exams including CCNA and Network+. The sheer convenience of it being a practice test from a mobile app makes it super convenient to take out and practice a couple of questions spradically when I have moments of downtime.
