# Road to Junos #
After coming off of my [CCNA](https://github.com/bobchen48/Writeups/blob/main/CCNA/My%20CCNA%20Journey.md) last month, I decided to hop into the Juniper landscape starting with JNCIA - Junos, which I was able to accomplish on April 28th. While CCNA to Juniper is not the biggest jump due to lots of overlaps in Networking fundamental knowledge, there still is a good deal of new terminologies (that are unique to Juniper) that I had to learn to adaquetely perpare for the exam
